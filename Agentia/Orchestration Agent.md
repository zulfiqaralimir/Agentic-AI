# Orchestration Agent

An **orchestration agent** is the "conductor" of a multi-agent system, ensuring that all specialized agents work together efficiently toward a common objective.

## Core Functions

### 1. Task Allocation
- Evaluates the overall goal and decomposes it into smaller tasks.
- Assigns tasks to suitable agents based on capabilities, workload, or performance metrics.
- Uses predefined rules, heuristics, or advanced algorithms (e.g., market-based approaches) for efficient task distribution.

### 2. Communication
- Establishes communication channels between agents.
- Uses REST APIs, message queues, or event-driven architectures to enable data exchange.
- Ensures seamless information flow for coordinated agent interaction.

### 3. Conflict Resolution
- Identifies and mitigates conflicts, such as resource contention or dependency issues.
- Implements mechanisms for dynamic priority adjustments, task reassignment, or resource mediation.

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Tracks individual agent and system-wide performance using key metrics.
- Detects underperforming agents, delays, or bottlenecks.
- Enables dynamic adjustments to task assignments and resource allocation.

## Implementation Insights

### Architectural Approach

#### Microservices and Containerization
- Orchestration agents are often built as **microservices**, deployed using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**.
- Supports **scalability**, **fault isolation**, and **service discovery**.

#### Communication Mechanisms
- **REST APIs**: Synchronous, request-response interactions for immediate task execution.
- **Message Queues/Event Buses**: Asynchronous communication using **RabbitMQ**, **Kafka**, or **MQTT** for decoupled agent interactions.

### Task Allocation and Conflict Resolution

#### Task Decomposition and Scheduling
- Uses weighted round-robin, market-based
